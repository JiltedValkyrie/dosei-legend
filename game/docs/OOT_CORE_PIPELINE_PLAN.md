# Plan: bulk decomp pipeline ("oot-core" on Saturn)

## Context
Hand-port 1 system at time -> guess behavior, bugs pile up (BUG log long). zeldaret/oot at
D:\Workspace-Claude\game-decomps\n64\oot already extracted (ntsc-1.2) + built. 456 actor .c.
Want: compile REAL decomp game code for SH-2 in bulk, convert float in bulk, convert all music
in bulk. Our Saturn renderer/audio stay as backend. 4 MB cart required -> code room exist.

## Hard truths (must design around)
- f32 everywhere (`typedef float f32` ultratypes.h:24). SH-2 no FPU. Soft-float = ~10x slow. Not ship.
- Fixed 16.16 overflow: OoT pos up to ±~10000 units, distSq overflow fast. Blind swap break math.
- Actors draw via N64 Gfx display lists (gSPDisplayList, matrices). Need shim, not VDP1 native.
- RAM: OoT code ~1 MB + overlays. Fit cart if overlays load per scene like N64.

## Approach (phased, each phase gate)
### Phase 0 — spike, prove or kill (do first)
1. New dir `game/oot-core/` (or `shared/oot-core/`). Build decomp C files as **C++** for SH-2 with
   `f32` = `Fx` class (32-bit store, int64 mul/div, saturate/assert on overflow in debug).
   Mechanical: no hand edit of logic. Script `tools/oot_core_import.py` copies listed decomp files,
   applies regex fixups for C-vs-C++ (void* casts, designated init) only.
2. Math lib: sinf/cosf/sqrtf/atan2 -> tables + SH-2 DIVU. `Math_*`, `Math3D_*` dist functions
   get int64 internal path (fix distSq overflow at source, once).
3. Port tiny slice: z_actor.c core + z_lib.c + 1 simple actor (En_Kusa grass, has drop table) +
   z_collision_check minimal. Stub libultra/gfx (`Gfx` writes -> recorder).
4. Measure on target: cycles per actor update (SH-2 disasm check no `__adds f`/soft-float).
   Gate: if update cost too high or overflow everywhere -> stop, report.

### Phase 1 — core systems bulk
z_bgcheck (collision), z_collision_check, z_actor, z_camera, z_player, z_play loop, z_message,
save. Replace our hand ports gradually behind flag; keep our renderer.

### Phase 2 — draw shim
Offline: convert actor/object display lists -> our VDP1 mesh format (extend
`game/tools/build_actor_model.py`). Runtime: `gSPDisplayList(seg addr)` -> lookup prebuilt mesh +
current matrix -> existing kokiri_sgl draw. No runtime F3DEX parse of triangles.

### Phase 3 — actors in bulk
Import actor overlays scene by scene (Kokiri first). Each actor: compile, link draw shim. Drops
come free (real code).

### Music bulk (parallel, independent)
`shared/tools/build_title_audio.py` already convert OoT seq -> SCSP score, fail on unknown opcode.
Run over ALL sequences, collect unsupported-opcode list, implement missing opcodes once in
`shared/lib/music/music.c`. Output full bank. SFX same path later.

## Critical files
- new: `game/oot-core/**`, `game/tools/oot_core_import.py`, fixed `Fx` header
- `game/makefile` (add C++ objects, SH-2 g++ from sh2eb-elf)
- `shared/tools/build_title_audio.py`, `shared/lib/music/music.c`
- `game/docs/DEMO_PLAN.md` (record strategy + phase status, required rule)

## Verification
- Host: compile oot-core natively, run actor update vs real float build, compare outputs (diff tolerance).
- Target: build clean image, disasm check no soft-float helpers, cycle count report.
- Human runs Kronos/Saroo test (no emulator launch by agent).
- Music: build all seqs, report coverage %.

## Risk
Phase 0 may fail perf. Then fallback: keep hand-port but drive it from decomp source per system
(current way) + bulk music still win.
