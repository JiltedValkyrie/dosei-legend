# Opus: fix near-camera warping next

## Current project

The Jo reorganization is integrated into main. Active game: `game/`; reusable
libraries/assets: `shared/`; GUI launcher and mesh workshop: root `tools/`.
Start the selector with `launch-game.bat`. Standard and 320x480i remain separate.
Build from `game/` with `./build.sh` or `./build.sh --hires`.
Generated code/images/staging live in `game/build/`. Do not resume the archived
libyaul renderer or its performance experiments. Preserve unrelated local edits.

Both modes built after relocation; 39 game and 10 workshop tests passed. Both
GUI smoke checks passed. Existing Forest quad editing revisions/preferences were
preserved in ignored `workspace/meshes/`, including the original Forest asset ID.
Those candidates are **not runtime-ready** and Prefer quads still does not affect
the game build.

## Human priority

Really fix the polygon/texture warping near the camera. It is almost unplayable,
not cosmetic polish. The human has seen other Jo Engine projects with much less
warping. Do not dismiss this as an unavoidable hardware limitation without
checking how our geometry, texture mapping and clipping differ from those paths.
There is no established cause yet. Higher resolution is not the fix.

## Focused investigation and implementation

1. Reproduce one clearly failing ground polygon at a recorded camera pose. Check
   the same view while walking and turning, including a near-plane crossing.
   Distinguish ordinary within-face distortion from incorrect clipped coverage,
   corner/texture mapping or ordering. A small diagnostic texture is useful if
   needed; do not launch a broad renderer rewrite or benchmarking exercise.
2. Compare the path against a working local Jo/SGL textured example: corner
   ordering, texture assignment, polygon shape/size and near-clip behavior.
   Use the human's other examples if supplied; none have been identified by name
   in the handoff, so do not claim that comparison has already been done.
3. Relevant files: `game/tools/build_sgl_scene.py`, `game/src/kokiri_sgl.c`,
   `shared/tools/build_kokiri_scene.py`. Current input repeats the third index as
   the fourth corner, textures are baked per triangle, and SGL attributes include
   `UseNearClip`. These are facts to investigate, not proof of a particular cause.
4. Implement the demonstrated remedy. If it needs subdivision or genuine quads,
   preserve texture coordinates/material boundaries and update texture baking
   and runtime input together. Merely changing corner indices or selecting the
   workshop's Prefer quads option is not a complete conversion. If clipping is
   responsible, preserve the correct texture mapping on the clipped geometry.
5. Preserve world-space collision, controls, Link, title/music and both launch
   modes. Y negation is baked at the rendering boundary; do not reintroduce a
   reflection that breaks the existing normals/culling. Keep polygon, vertex,
   texture and RAM capacity checks enabled if geometry counts change.

## Done enough

Show the previously failing close-ground view readable during movement and turns,
without giant stretched wedges, missing ground or hidden faces used to mask it.
Keep an honest before/after at the same pose, plus a short check in the other
display mode. Build and focused checks suffice; expand only to investigate this
major bug. Accepted submissions and a high FPS counter alone do not prove a fix.

Then resume walk/idle animation, one NPC conversation, menus and sound effects.
Music timing and general efficiency are not gates. Update `VSLICEPROGRESS.md`.
